# Heart Failure - Excel Project
This project is an analysis of the factors that contribute to heart failure. It examines the ways in which various factors, such as diabetes, anemia, high blood pressure, age range, and gender, affect the occurrence of heart failure.


## Preprocessing Data
Throughout my project, I utilized both Excel and PowerPoint to analyze and present my findings.

### Visualization
Throughout the project, I have incorporated pie charts and bar charts to visually represent and analyze the data.
